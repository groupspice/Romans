        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overemphasize one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship. Rarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, ministry, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a memory verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live. This section of each session typically o ers you two activities. You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker ques- tion, and/or you can check in with one or two group members—your7]]></text>

A Deepening Life Together: Romans Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Greg Sidders. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discussion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section). At the end of each session in this study guide you will  nd space for your notes on the teaching segment.GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passages you’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. The focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.SHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’sscary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy 8]]></text>

It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.Study NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (Optional)If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more biblical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide you with plenty to discuss within the group. These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group.9]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstYou can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.10]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONWelcome to the Deepening Life Together Bible study on the book of Romans. We will experience life together these next seven weeks as the apostle Paul leads us through his greatest theological work—his magnum opus—written to the church in Rome. The journey we are about to embark on will take us step-by-step through the truth of the gospel as it relates to the topics of condemnation, justi cation, and sancti cation. As we read, discuss, and re ect on the topic of each session, we will be encouraged to give ourselves completely to God and live lives in appropriate response to God’s greatest gift of salvation and worthy of our new position in Jesus Christ.Week by week, we will see Paul’s doctrine of justi cation revealed through the pages of Scripture as we learn  rst what it means to be condemned and how we came to be in that condition. Secondly, we will discover how we, as human beings unable to save ourselves, can be brought back into a relationship with God by being declared righ- teous through faith in Jesus Christ’s sacri cial death on the cross. Finally, in the climax and resolution to the study, we will discover how, having been freed from our bondage to sin, the Law, and death, to live our new lives through the power of the Spirit.This journey of discovery will make known God’s purposes for our lives. We will connect with our loving and faithful God and with other believers in small group community. We will become his hands and feet here on earth as he reveals our uniqueness and his willing- ness to use us. We will experience the closeness that he desires with11]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION ONEAN INTRODUCTION TO ROMANSMemory Verse: But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness from God comesthrough faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe (Rom. 3:21–22 NIV).On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther nailed his renowned Ninety-Five Theses to the door of the All Saint’s Church in Wittenberg, Ger- many. Convinced that the church of his day had become corrupted, Luther, a German monk and theologian, contested the teaching of his contemporaries through his theses.Centuries earlier, the apostle Paul had explained how we are justi-  ed. Justi cation (or righteousness) is an image from the law courts. It means being acquitted of crimes. It also means being restored to right relationship with the person we have wronged—in this case, God. Normally a judge acquits someone because that person is in- nocent, but as we will see in Romans, God has made a way to satisfy the demands of justice while still acquitting us, even though we are guilty.13]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[RomansConnectingAs you begin Session One, ask the Lord in prayer to unify your group and challenge you as you study his Word during these next seven weeks.Take time to pass around a copy of the Small Group Roster, a sheet of paper, or one of you pass your study guide, opened to the Small Group Roster. Each of you write down your contact informa- tion including the best time and method for contacting you. Then, someone volunteer to make copies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, and what you do for fun. You may also include whether or not you are married, how long you have been married, how many children you have, and their ages. Also share what brought you to this small group study of Romans, and what you expect to learn during the next seven weeks.2. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your values together. In the Appen- dix is a Small Group Agreement with the values most useful in sustaining healthy, balanced groups. Choose two or three values that you have room to grow in or haven’t previously focused on—to emphasize during this study. Doing this will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health.3. When you were a child and you did something wrong, how did you and your parents generally deal with the situation?GrowingCentral to the development of a  rst-century theology and ethic, Paul’s letter to the church in Rome is considered by many to be his greatest theological work and the greatest of all the epistles.

Romans is Paul’s statement of the gospel, the good news that God has sent Paul to proclaim to the world. What can we learn about this news from 1:1–5, 16–17? What questions do these statements about the gospel raise for you?5. Faith is an important word in Romans. See the Study Note on faith. What does obedience have to do with faith (1:5)?6. Another central term in Romans is righteousness (1:17). God is perfectly just, so people who behave unjustly can’t have a close relationship with him. Do you think God (and his fol- lowers) should just get over making such a big deal about righ- teousness or justice, and talk about love instead? Explain your thoughts.7. Jesus and his  rst followers were all Jews. Paul was Jewish too. But part of Paul’s calling was to invite non-Jews (Gentiles) to the intimate relationship with God that until then had been for Jews only. This was a radical idea at the time, and Paul spends a lot of time in Romans explaining how Jews and Gentiles each  t into the amazing good news he proclaims. What does he say about each group in 1:16; 2:9–11?8. Are you a Jew or a Gentile? Does it matter to you that Jesus was Jewish, that the Scriptures were  rst given to Jews, and that God enabled Gentiles to get in on the gift of this Jewish Savior? How, or why not?9. One of Paul’s purposes in writing Romans was to make the case that everyone, Jew and Gentile alike, is guilty before God because of their sin. Look at the following fourteen key argu- ments Paul makes in Romans 3:10–18 regarding sin.There is no one righteous, not even one;there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.15]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[RomansAll have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit. The poison of vipers is on their lips.Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.Their feet are swift to shed blood; ruin and misery mark theirways,and the way of peace they do not know.There is no fear of God before their eyes. (NIV)Why is it so important to understand that everyone is sin- ful and guilty before God, regardless of their background or beliefs? (See Romans 3:19–20 for help.)10. The law given to the Jews in the Old Testament demonstrated that all people, Jews and Gentiles, were lawbreakers at their core. Now read Romans 3:21–22. What do we learn from these verses about how both Jews and Gentiles become right with God? See the Study Notes for more information about salva- tion and faith.11. We are made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ. In Ro- mans 6–8, Paul shows how we then live by faith in Jesus Christ through the empowering presence of the Holy Spirit. Read Romans 8:26–30. What does Paul say here about our new life in the Holy Spirit?12. In Romans 12–15, Paul describes what life by faith in Christ, in the power of the Holy Spirit, looks like. How does he sum- marize the life of faith in 12:1–2?13. This has been a fast overview of some of the highlights of this book!

        <text><![CDATA[An Introduction to RomansThe theme of Romans, the gospel message, is re ected throughout the book. In the next six sessions of this study we will explore Paul’s systematic presentation of the gospel that he had been preaching for more than twenty years, as well as the practical application of the gospel in everyday life.DevelopingGod has given every believer special gifts to be used for serving him and the body of Christ as the Holy Spirit leads. As we strive to deepen our relationship with him through prayer, re ection, and meditation on his Word, we begin developing the gifts that God has given each of us. Through these disciplines, we learn how to hear his still small voice and submit to the leading of the Holy Spirit.14. Developing our ability to serve God according to the leading of the Holy Spirit requires that we make time to let God speak to us daily. Which of the following next steps toward this goal are you willing to take for the next few weeks?t Prayer. Commit to connecting with God daily through per- sonal prayer. It’s important to separate yourself from the distractions in your life so you can really focus on commu- nicating with God. Some people  nd it helpful to write out their prayers in a journal.t Re ection. At the end of each session you’ll  nd Re ections Scriptures that speci cally relate to the topic of our study each week. These are provided to give you an opportunity for reading a short Bible passage  ve days a week during the course of this study. Write down your insights on what you read each day in the space provided. On the sixth day, sum- marize what God has shown you throughout the week.t Meditation. Meditation is focused attention on the Word of God and is a great way to internalize God’s Word more deeply. Copy a portion of Scripture on a card and tape it somewhere in your line of sight, such as your car’s dash- board or the kitchen table. Think about it when you sit at17]]></text>

Several passages for meditation are suggested on the Re ections pages in each session.SurrenderingWorship means to revere or adore God. Hebrews 12:28–29 says, “Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, for our ‘God is a consuming  re’” (NIV). As receivers of his kingdom, let’s o er praise to our God, as he deserves.15. Spend a few minutes praising God aloud. You may highlight some of the attributes of God’s character or praise him for speci c circumstances in your life.t Someone o er your musical gifts to lead the group in a wor- shipsong.Youmighttrysingingasimplechorusacappella, with guitar or piano accompaniment, or with a worship CD.t Read a passage of Scripture aloud together, making it a time of praise and worship as the words remind you of all God has done for you. Choose a psalm or other favorite verse.16. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. Your time with God is individual and re ects who you are in relationship with our personal God. However you choose to spend your time with him, try to allow time for praise, prayer, and reading of Scripture.At the end of each session we provide Re ections for you to use in your daily time with him. There are  ve daily Scripture readings with space to record your thoughts. On the sixth day there is space to record your summary of the  ve re ections. These will o er reinforcement of the principles we are learn- ing, and develop or strengthen your habit of time alone with God throughout the week.18]]></text>

Before you close your group in prayer, answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report and commit to praying for each other throughout the week.Study NotesFaith: A belief in or con dent attitude toward God, involving com- mitment to his will for one’s life. Genuine saving faith is a personal attachment to Christ, best thought of as a combination of two ideas—reliance on Christ and commitment to him. Saving faith involves personally depending on the  nished work of Christ’s sac- ri ce as the only basis for forgiveness of sin and a right relationship with God.Salvation: Deliverance from the power of sin; redemption. The sal- vation that comes through Christ may be described in three tenses: past, present, and future. When we believe in Christ, we are saved (Acts 16:31). But we are also in the process of being saved from the power of sin (Rom. 8:13; Phil. 2:12). Finally, we shall be saved from the very presence of sin (Rom. 13:11; Titus 2:12–13).For Deeper Study (Optional)1. Before he became a Christian, Paul went by his Jewish name, Saul. Read Acts 7:54–8:2, in which for the  rst time a Jewish Christian was killed in Jerusalem for saying that Jesus was the Messiah. What do you learn about Saul/Paul?2. Read Acts 9:1–19. What moved Saul/Paul to change? What might this experience have been like for him?3. Read Acts 9:20–30. What was Paul like as a brand-new Christian?19]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Romans4. Read Galatians 1:13–16; 2:15–20. How does Paul describe the transformation when a Jew stops relying on the Law of Moses for acceptance from God? What might it have been like for Paul, a devout Jew, to come to grips with the possibility that Christ had changed the rules, welcomed Gentiles, and made law-keeping irrelevant? What does his story say to you about your life? What light does his story shed on what he says in Romans about Jews and Gentiles? About law and grace?ReflectionsReading, re ecting, and meditating on the Word of God is essential to getting to know him deeply. As you read the verses each day, give prayerful consideration to what you learn about God, his Spirit, and his place in your life. Then record your thoughts, insights, or prayer in the Re ect section below the verses you read. On the sixth day, record a summary of what you learned over the entire week through this study.Day 1. I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes:  rst for the Jew, then for the Gentile. For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from  rst to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith” (Rom. 1:16–17 NIV).REFLECT  ____________________________________________________________  ____________________________________________________________  ____________________________________________________________  ____________________________________________________________20]]></text>

A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a fewpeopleorforexistinggroupsthatloseafewpeoplealongtheway. We encourage you to pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another good strategy is to ask church leaders to make an announcement that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too79]]></text>

The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s totally up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months together, but every other week can work as well. We strongly recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if at all possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch relationships that last for years, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direction, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have something to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will ma- ture and members will share the facilitation of meetings. We have discovered that healthy groups share hosting and leading of the group. This model ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.80]]></text>

We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. You may try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to meet in the living room or dining room, and share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can be with the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their children all evening when their children are too young to be left at home. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the responsi- bility of providing a lesson or care for the children either in the same home or in another home nearby. This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. No mat- ter what decision the group makes, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.81]]></text>

Perhaps in an e-mail or on cards handed out at the study, have everyone write down three things you did well and one thing you could improve on.

        <text><![CDATA[Session One An Introduction to RomansConnecting1. We’ve designed this study for both new and established groups, and for both seekers and the spiritually mature. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other. Established groups often want to dig deeper into Bible study and application. Regardless of whether your group is new or has been together for a while, be sure to answer this introductory question at this  rst session.2. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con-  icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.We recommend talking about shared ownership of the group. It’s impor- tant that each member have a role. See the Appendix to learn more about Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.If your group is new, you may want to focus on welcoming newcomers or on sharing group ownership. Any group will quickly move from being121LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

See the Team Roles in the Appendix for help on how to do this well.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.4. The gospel is God’s. The Old Testament prophets pointed toward it. It is about God’s Son, who is fully human in that he descended from King David, but who is also divine. His bodily resurrection from the dead is proof of this, and this resurrection lies at the core of the good news. Also central is that the good news calls people to have faith in Christ, and this faith involves obeying him. It is trust revealed in action. The good news also involves God using his power to save those who have this kind of faith in him. Save them from what? Romans will explain that. Righteousness, too, is central to this news.Write these questions down, and look at them again at the end of this study to see which have been answered. This study will be too brief to answer all of your questions, but it should answer many. Maybe someone in the group would like the job of tracking down answers to any questions that remain unanswered by the end of the study.5. Faith isn’t just an intellectual agreement with a list of information about Jesus Christ. It is trust in him as a person. Trusting him involves doing what he says to do. The  rst eight chapters of Romans detail what God has done for us through Christ. Chapters 12–15 describe how we respond in faithful obedience. The Holy Spirit plays an essential role in enabling us to live (obey) by faith.6. “Righteousness” and “justi cation” translate the same Greek word. Righ- teousness is about justice. Most of us want to be treated justly, and we’re genuinely upset when we see terrible injustices committed against us or other people. But many people today  nd it hard to see their faults as serious enough to warrant the kind of wrath (1:18) that Paul talks about in Romans. They think Christians should emphasize God’s love and stop talking about wrath, hell, and so on. In session 2 we’ll look at Paul’s argu- ment for why we should see ourselves as wrongdoers. He’s not interested in fostering neurotic guilt over insigni cant matters. Rather, he wants us to come to grips with the ways we genuinely insult God and harm others.7. Salvation is  rst for Jews, then for Gentiles. That may seem like God is playing favorites. But God also judges the wrongdoing of Jews  rst, then Gentiles. God doesn’t play favorites, but he has a plan for each group. In122]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesRomans 9–11 Paul has a lot to say about the role Jews and Gentiles each play in God’s plan.8. It is important to understand the universality of sin and rebellion because all are accountable to God. No one is made right with God unless they are willing to face their own sinfulness.11. We have been called according to his purpose to be conformed to the image of his Son, to be made like him in character. God justi ed us, bringing us into a restored, intimate relationship with himself. With the Holy Spirit’s help, we increasingly become people who do what is just and right. Glory is our destiny. The Spirit intercedes for us with God, so that nothing can separate us from his love.12. Living a life that is acceptable to God is an act of worship. It’s not about us; it is about God—giving all that we are and have to him. We o er our bodies completely; we allow our minds to be transformed. We are able to do this by trusting Christ and responding to the guidance and power of the Holy Spirit.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.14. The intent of this question is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a commitment to a good Bible reading plan, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes their life.The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week during the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to see the importance of making this time to connect with God a priority in their life. O er fur- ther encouragement to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.Suggested exercise: To help the group get started with meditating on the Word of God, provide everyone with a 3×5 index card. Have everyone123]]></text>

This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will provide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.15. Singing a song of praise, reading Scripture aloud together, or speaking words of praise to God are all excellent ways of focusing our attention on God for a time of surrender. Each session includes an activity that will help the group achieve an attitude of praise and worship.16. Encourage group members to use the Re ections verses in their daily quiet time throughout the week. This will move them closer to God while re- inforcing the lesson of this session through related Scripture.17. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept in con dence if you are to have safety and bonding among the group members.Use the Prayer and Praise Report in the Appendix to record your prayer requests. There you can keep track of requests and celebrate answers to prayer.For Deeper StudyWe have included an optional For Deeper Study section in each ses- sion. For Deeper Study provides additional passages for individual study on the topic of each session. If your group likes to do deeper Bible study, consider having members study the For Deeper Study passages at home between meetings.124]]></text>
