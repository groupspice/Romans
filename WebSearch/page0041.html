<noscript> Leader’s NotesRomans 9–11 Paul has a lot to say about the role Jews and Gentiles each play in God’s plan.8. It is important to understand the universality of sin and rebellion because all are accountable to God. No one is made right with God unless they are willing to face their own sinfulness.11. We have been called according to his purpose to be conformed to the image of his Son, to be made like him in character. God justi ed us, bringing us into a restored, intimate relationship with himself. With the Holy Spirit’s help, we increasingly become people who do what is just and right. Glory is our destiny. The Spirit intercedes for us with God, so that nothing can separate us from his love.12. Living a life that is acceptable to God is an act of worship. It’s not about us; it is about God—giving all that we are and have to him. We o er our bodies completely; we allow our minds to be transformed. We are able to do this by trusting Christ and responding to the guidance and power of the Holy Spirit.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.14. The intent of this question is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a commitment to a good Bible reading plan, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes their life.The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week during the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to see the importance of making this time to connect with God a priority in their life. O er fur- ther encouragement to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.Suggested exercise: To help the group get started with meditating on the Word of God, provide everyone with a 3×5 index card. Have everyone123 </noscript>
