<noscript> Leader’s Notes“the leader’s group” to “our group” if everyone understands the goals of the group and shares a small role. See the Team Roles in the Appendix for help on how to do this well.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.4. The gospel is God’s. The Old Testament prophets pointed toward it. It is about God’s Son, who is fully human in that he descended from King David, but who is also divine. His bodily resurrection from the dead is proof of this, and this resurrection lies at the core of the good news. Also central is that the good news calls people to have faith in Christ, and this faith involves obeying him. It is trust revealed in action. The good news also involves God using his power to save those who have this kind of faith in him. Save them from what? Romans will explain that. Righteousness, too, is central to this news.Write these questions down, and look at them again at the end of this study to see which have been answered. This study will be too brief to answer all of your questions, but it should answer many. Maybe someone in the group would like the job of tracking down answers to any questions that remain unanswered by the end of the study.5. Faith isn’t just an intellectual agreement with a list of information about Jesus Christ. It is trust in him as a person. Trusting him involves doing what he says to do. The  rst eight chapters of Romans detail what God has done for us through Christ. Chapters 12–15 describe how we respond in faithful obedience. The Holy Spirit plays an essential role in enabling us to live (obey) by faith.6. “Righteousness” and “justi cation” translate the same Greek word. Righ- teousness is about justice. Most of us want to be treated justly, and we’re genuinely upset when we see terrible injustices committed against us or other people. But many people today  nd it hard to see their faults as serious enough to warrant the kind of wrath (1:18) that Paul talks about in Romans. They think Christians should emphasize God’s love and stop talking about wrath, hell, and so on. In session 2 we’ll look at Paul’s argu- ment for why we should see ourselves as wrongdoers. He’s not interested in fostering neurotic guilt over insigni cant matters. Rather, he wants us to come to grips with the ways we genuinely insult God and harm others.7. Salvation is  rst for Jews, then for Gentiles. That may seem like God is playing favorites. But God also judges the wrongdoing of Jews  rst, then Gentiles. God doesn’t play favorites, but he has a plan for each group. In122 </noscript>
